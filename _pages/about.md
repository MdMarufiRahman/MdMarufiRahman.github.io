### Welcome!
<p align="justify">
Hi, I am a third year Ph.D. student in computer science and engineering student at <a href="https://www.unt.edu" target="_blank"> Univeristy of North Texas</a>. My research interest areas are computer vision, Deep learning and medical image analysis. My main goal for my doctoral research is to develop efficient technique for computer aided diagnosis(CAD). I am currently working on domain adaptation challenge for colonoscopy images.

I have much experience with teaching. I was instructor for Fundamental of Database course and worked as a teaching assistant for application of cryptography, programming and problem solving with C++, database administration and multimedia computing.
<br>My supervisor is Dr. JungHwan Oh.
<br> Other committee members are:
Dr. Mark Albert, Dr. Serder Bozdag, Dr. Heng Fan.

## About Me
<p align="justify">
I work at: <a href="http://www.cse.unt.edu/~jhoh/" target="_blank">Multimedia Information Group</a> lab.
Our lab has also collaboration with <a href="https://www.cs.iastate.edu//" target="_blank">Iowa State University</a>.
After completing my bachelor degree (electronics and telecommunication engineering)from <a href="https://www.ruet.ac.bd/" target="_blank"> Rajshahi University of Engineereing and Technology (Bangladesh)</a>, I joined Dr.Oh's lab.
<br>
<br>
I published my first reasearch paper at 2016. It was a project mainly focused on vehicle tracking with arduino. I did a lot of electronics and IoT(internet of Things) related project back then. Studying engineering in my undergrad was the best decision of my life  as it enabled me to explore different pathways of technology. My knack for problem solving and love for mathematics also make me a suitable candidate to earn the degree. 
<br>
<br>
In my final year of undergrad, I tried to solve some biomedical coil(transcanial magnetic coil) design problem for brain stimulation(to aid neurological disorder). I published two  research papers in that topic. After completing my undergraduate study, I decided to create more impact with my knowledge for cancer diagnosis related problem. I believe if a well diagnosis can be performed, then it will be always easier to prevent cancer related health risks.
<br>
<br>
After an extensive search I found a complete match with my supervisor's work. Our lab has a focused research on computer aided diagnosis for gastrointestinal diseases. In colonsocopy or endoscopy images, because of the images' nature (texture of colon, specular reflection,blurry frames) it is always hard to get useful information from those frames. There are also data-scarcity, image annotation, domain adaptation issues for this type of medical image dataset. Solving those problems will create a big impact on medical image analysis. I mainly focus on solving those medical image related problems with deep learning and standard image processing techniques.
