### Welcome!
<p align="justify">
Hi, I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in computer science and engineering student at <a href="https://www.unt.edu" target="_blank"> Univeristy of North Texas</a>. My research interest areas are computer vision, Deep learning and medical image analysis. My main goal for my doctoral research is to develop efficient technique for computer aided diagnosis. I am currently working on domain adaptation challenge for colonoscopy images.

I have much experience with teaching. I was instructor for Fundamental of Database course and worked as a teaching assistant for application of cryptography, programming and problem solving with C++, database administration and multimedia computing.
<br>My supervisor is Dr. JungHwan Oh.
<br> Other committee members are:
Dr. Mark Albert, Dr. Serder Bozdag, Dr. Heng Fan.

## About Me
<p align="justify">
My lab is: <a href="http://www.cse.unt.edu/~jhoh/" target="_blank">Multimedia Information Group</a>.
Our lab has also collaboration with <a href="https://www.cs.iastate.edu//" target="_blank">Iowa State University</a>.
After completing my bachelor degree (electronics and telecommunication engineering)from <a href="https://www.ruet.ac.bd/" target="_blank"> Rajshahi University of Engineereing and Technology (Bangladesh)</a>, I joined Dr.Oh's lab.
<br>
<br>
I published my first reasearch paper at 2016. It was a project mainly focused on vehicle tracking with arduino. I did a lot of electronics and embedded system related back then. Studying engineering in my undergrad was the best decision of my life  as it enabled me to explore different pathways of technology. My knack for problem solving and love for mathematics also makes a suitable candidate to earn the degree. 
<br>
<br>
In my final year of undergrad I tried to solve some biomedical coil design problem for brain stimulation. I published two  research paper in that topic. After graduation, I decided to create more impact with my knowledge for cancer related problem. I found if a well diagnosis can be performed, then it will be always easier to prevent cancer.
<br>
<br>
After an extensive search I found a complete match with my supervisor's work. In colonsocopy images there always happens misdetection. If we can gather solid information from those images then screening procedure will be much better. I mainly focus on solving those imaging problem with deep learning and standard image processing techniques.
