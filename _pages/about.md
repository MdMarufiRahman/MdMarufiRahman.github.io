### Welcome!
<p align="justify">
I’m a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of North Texas, working at the intersection of computer vision, motion estimation, and machine learning systems.
My research centers on building robust image and video analysis pipelines — from medical imaging (endoscopy and colonoscopy) to robotics and navigation. By combining deep learning, GPU acceleration, and geometric vision, I aim to solve problems where precision and reliability directly impact human safety.
I pursue this PhD to bridge fundamental research and real-world systems. My work has led to peer-reviewed publications and collaborations across labs and industry.
