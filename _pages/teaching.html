<ul>
  <li>TA experience complemented my research by continuously exposing me to real-world systems (databases, secure computing, data structures) and reinforced my debugging, mentoring, and technical design review skills.</li>
  <li>Regularly mentored 100+ students per semester, reviewed project designs, and held office hours to break down complex technical concepts — enhancing my ability to communicate and lead within technical teams.</li>
  <li>Supported instruction for several undergrad and graduate-level CS courses at University of North Texas, including:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Software Engineering (CSCE 3444)</strong>: Guided students in software design, version control (Git), Agile practices, and test-driven development for team-based projects — experience directly aligned with industry workflows.</li>
      <li><strong>Database Systems (CSCE 4350, 4355)</strong>: Assisted with schema design, query optimization, and transaction management — reinforcing scalable backend system concepts.</li>
      <li><strong>Computing Foundations (CSCE 2110)</strong>: Mentored students in core data structures and algorithms using C++, aligned with system-level thinking and coding interviews.</li>
      <li><strong>Cryptography (CSCE 5050)</strong>: Supported assignments involving real-world encryption and secure protocols.</li>
      <li><strong>Multimedia Computing (CSCE 5390)</strong>: Helped with multimedia data analysis projects, connecting closely to my research in computer vision and image processing.</li>
    </ul>
